#Ponchik Backend
##What is this?
Ponchik means doughnut in Russian, which has zero significance other than it's easy to pronounce, remember, sounds good
when said in english, and most importantly ponchiks are delicious! So what is this project? Well it's a long thought of
project for learning to read Russian. I want it to be be more than just a 'click the word to translate reader,' since
Russian has a lot of morphing going on I want the user to be able to click on a word they don't know, then recieve that
word in all it's forms, translation, a simple definition, and some sample sentences. The definitions and sample sentences
will be generated with LLM. To help with memorizing the words any words the user clicks will be added to a personal dictionary
which they can be drilled on with various forms of exercises; this can be a simple as fill in the blank, complete the ending
based on case, match the definition with the words, the list goes on.
